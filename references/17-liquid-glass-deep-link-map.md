# Liquid Glass Deep Link Map

Use this reference when a task needs to explore Liquid Glass beyond the main adoption pages: related HIG pages, SwiftUI/UIKit/AppKit APIs, navigation surfaces, scroll-edge behavior, background extension, button styles, icon/widget implications, or platform-specific boundaries.

Read order:

1. `14-liquid-glass-adoption.md` for the strategy and cross-platform boundary.
2. `15-liquid-glass-controls.md` for control design decisions.
3. `16-liquid-glass-api-motion-color.md` for implementation recipes.
4. This file when you need to know which official Apple link to open next and how to classify it.

## Crawl Scope

Snapshot: 2026-07-14.

Source method: official Apple Developer/HIG pages and Apple documentation markdown endpoints, starting from:

- HIG Materials, especially Liquid Glass and Standard materials.
- HIG Color, especially Liquid Glass color and System colors.
- HIG Scroll views, Toolbars, Sidebars, Tab bars, Buttons, App icons, Icons, SF Symbols, Dark Mode, Accessibility.
- Technology overview: Liquid Glass and Adopting Liquid Glass.
- SwiftUI Landmarks Liquid Glass article and linked Landmarks subtopics.
- SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit APIs linked from the adoption and custom-view pages.

Classification rule:

- **Primary**: page directly defines Liquid Glass, its behavior, or its APIs.
- **Design support**: page is not only about glass, but changes how glass should be used in frontend design.
- **Implementation support**: API page needed for platform implementation or fallback.
- **Apple-specific**: useful as Apple platform knowledge, but do not generalize to cross-platform UI.
- **Low signal**: page mentions glass only through shared metadata, card thumbnails, or unrelated examples; route through the normal HIG category instead.

## HIG Design Support Links

| Page | Why it matters for Liquid Glass | Route |
|---|---|---|
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color | Glass can inherit background color and must work in light, dark, and increased contrast contexts | `01`, `14`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/dark-mode | Glass is adaptive; custom colors need light/dark/high-contrast variants | `01`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility | Reduced transparency, increased contrast, reduced motion, VoiceOver labels | `04`, `14`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/scroll-views | Defines scroll-edge effects for content moving behind floating controls | `12`, `16`, this file |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toolbars | Toolbars adopt glass; group related actions; prefer standard components and concentric custom corners | `12`, `15`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tab-bars | Tab bars float above content, can use glass, and need color contrast against content | `12`, `15`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sidebars | Sidebar glass needs legible content and may use background extension for adjacent media | `12`, `13`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons | Button color/background collisions matter more when controls sit on glass | `02`, `15`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sheets | Inset/rounded sheets can show content peeking through; task focus may require more opacity | `12`, `15`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/action-sheets | Action sheets originate from invoking controls; map to anchored contextual menus on Web | `12`, `15` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/lists-and-tables | Content-layer surfaces need padding/row rhythm, not permanent glass backgrounds | `11`, `12`, `16` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons | Liquid Glass-era app icons are layered and dynamic; Apple-specific export flow | `13`, `14`, this file |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/icons | Toolbars/menus should use clear standard icons and accessible labels | `11`, `12`, `15` |
| https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols | Apple-only symbol resource; use the sizing/weight model, not unlicensed assets off Apple platforms | `13` |

Low-signal examples: HIG input pages can mention glass through page-level related cards, but if the page's main topic is gestures, game controllers, or generic touch behavior, keep it in `12-hig-components-inputs.md` unless the task is explicitly about glass overlays for those inputs.

## Color And Semantic System APIs

Use this section when glass surfaces need light/dark/high-contrast behavior or native-client semantic colors.

| Platform | Pages | Use |
|---|---|---|
| HIG | https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color#System-colors | Prefer semantic color roles instead of hardcoded RGB on glass |
| SwiftUI | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Color | Map foregrounds, separators, accents, and backgrounds to semantic tokens |
| UIKit | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIColor | Use `label`, `secondaryLabel`, `systemBackground`, `separator`, grouped backgrounds |
| AppKit | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSColor | Use `labelColor`, `controlBackgroundColor`, `windowBackgroundColor`, separator and selection colors |

Cross-platform rule: define custom tokens for default, dark, increased contrast, reduced transparency, and disabled states. Do not rely on a single translucent fill plus white text.

## Landmarks Topic Map

| Landmarks topic | What to extract | Cross-platform use |
|---|---|---|
| https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Landmarks-Building-an-app-with-Liquid-Glass | Overall app structure and sequence | Use as case study, not a template to copy |
| https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Landmarks-Applying-a-background-extension-effect | Edge-to-edge media next to sidebar/inspector | Background/media extension only |
| https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Landmarks-Extending-horizontal-scrolling-under-a-sidebar-or-inspector | Horizontal collections interacting with side panels | Let carousels visually continue under chrome while keeping controls readable |
| https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Landmarks-Refining-the-system-provided-glass-effect-in-toolbars | Toolbar grouping | Split actions by semantic group, not by equal spacing |
| https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Landmarks-Displaying-custom-activity-badges | Custom badges and morphing groups | Compact status/action clusters with stable IDs |
| https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Landmarks-Creating-Liquid-Glass-effects-in-custom-views | Custom view glass effects | Use only for functional controls and badges |

If a Landmarks page is not available from the public data endpoint, use the local archive at `/Users/lukesong/Downloads/LandmarksBuildingAnAppWithLiquidGlass.zip` as secondary confirmation.

## Platform-Specific Boundaries

| Surface | Classification | Rule for cross-platform frontend |
|---|---|---|
| iOS / iPadOS / macOS bars, tabs, sidebars | Platform-informed transferable | Translate hierarchy, grouping, safe area, and contrast; do not clone exact OS chrome |
| watchOS | Apple-specific / low transfer | Liquid Glass changes are minimal and tied to standard watch controls |
| tvOS | Scenario inspiration | Focus-driven glass is useful for TV/kiosk UIs; not for ordinary Web hover states |
| visionOS | Mostly Apple-specific | Use depth/readability principles only when building spatial or layered interfaces |
| App icons and Icon Composer | Apple-specific / brand-gated | Use layered artwork concepts; do not copy Apple masks/assets or require Icon Composer off Apple platforms |
| SF Symbols | Apple resource / license-sensitive | Use symbol sizing/weight principles; use licensed icon sets outside Apple surfaces |
| Widgets | Platform-specific | Use glanceable hierarchy; do not generalize tinted/clear widget appearance to dense app pages |

## Transferable Design Rules

1. Separate **content layer** and **functional layer** before choosing any blur.
2. Use Liquid Glass only for controls, navigation, inspectors, media controls, status clusters, sheets/popovers, or direct-manipulation highlights.
3. Use standard material or solid surfaces for app backgrounds, content cards, dense tables, and text panels.
4. Choose regular glass by default; choose clear glass only over visually rich media and test with bright backgrounds.
5. Add scroll-edge treatment only when content actually scrolls under floating controls.
6. Group toolbar actions by function and separate groups with fixed spacing.
7. Make corner radii concentric with their containers.
8. Use one prominent tinted glass action per local region.
9. Provide semantic colors for light, dark, increased contrast, and reduced transparency.
10. Do not animate glass continuously; animate geometry, opacity, scale, radius, and state identity.
11. Use stable IDs for morphing groups; otherwise use simple fade/materialize.
12. Test with reduced motion, reduced transparency, keyboard focus, pointer, touch, and busy media backgrounds.

## Code Sketches

### Responsive Top-Level Navigation

Use this as a conceptual SwiftUI mapping for Apple-native work, then translate to responsive Web navigation.

```swift
TabView {
    Tab("Library", systemImage: "books.vertical") {
        LibraryView()
    }

    Tab("Search", systemImage: "magnifyingglass", role: .search) {
        SearchView()
    }
}
.tabViewStyle(.sidebarAdaptable)
.tabBarMinimizeBehavior(.onScrollDown)
```

Frontend translation: bottom nav on small screens, sidebar on wide screens, explicit search placement, and scroll-aware compaction only if the user can easily recover navigation.

### Scroll Edge For Custom Chrome

```css
.scroll-shell {
  position: relative;
  overflow: auto;
}

.floating-toolbar {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 10;
  backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(1.35);
  background: color-mix(in srgb, Canvas 68%, transparent);
}

.floating-toolbar::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: -18px;
  height: 18px;
  pointer-events: none;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, color-mix(in srgb, Canvas 42%, transparent), transparent);
}
```

Use only when scrolling content passes beneath the toolbar. This is not a decorative shadow.

### Background Extension

```css
.split-view {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(220px, 280px) 1fr;
}

.sidebar {
  position: relative;
  backdrop-filter: blur(22px) saturate(1.3);
  background: color-mix(in srgb, Canvas 70%, transparent);
}

.sidebar::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: var(--adjacent-media-preview);
  background-size: cover;
  filter: blur(18px);
  opacity: .22;
  z-index: -1;
}
```

Use mirrored or sampled media only as a background impression. Do not move readable text or essential controls under the sidebar.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Official source link is primary or design/implementation support, not low-signal metadata.
- [ ] Apple-only APIs are labeled as Apple-only before suggesting a cross-platform implementation.
- [ ] Liquid Glass is not used for content cards, dense forms, or generic decoration.
- [ ] A standard-material or solid fallback exists for reduced transparency and unsupported browsers.
- [ ] Motion is in `07-motion.md` / `09-motion-templates.md`; style tokens stay in `01` / `15` / `16`.
- [ ] HIG pages that are mainly about input/platform behavior route to `12` or `13`, not Liquid Glass, unless the task explicitly needs glass there.
